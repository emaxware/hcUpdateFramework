AutoUpdate Framework
-need to minimize configurations required for application
-Application should have it's GUID embedded as a resource
-modify the installer to:
	-register the installation (location) with the update server to get a LocationGUID and record it in the manifest
	-generate an initial manifest file
-launcher
	-launcher must validate manifest file (handle invalid XML files)
-ClientUpdateService
	-needs to be modified so one update service instance can update multiple applications (currently expects that it resides in application folder)
	-installer needs to check to ensure a previous ClientUpdateService instance is not installed, if it is update the config for it
	-
-UpdateServer
The Update Server expects the updates folder to be a subfolder under where it is installed
The DeploymentManager has an INI setting which must point to the folder used by the UpdateServer	
-ClientUpdateService needs to be installed in the folder where the EXE to be updated resides and a Manifest file must exist with the following content:
<Manifest LocationGUID="{1145FC6F-6046-49B7-9FE1-008140859052}" ApplicationGUID="" UpdateVersion="0.0.0.0" WhatsNew="Initial Manifest Created" IsMandatory="false" IsSilent="false" IsImmediate="false"><Item FileName="CAT.EXE" Version="0.0.0.0" TargetPath="E:\Data\v4\IRAS\Platform\win64\debug"/></Manifest>

-the locationGUID is the StudioGUID for the current studio




The Launcher needs to have Admin rights in order to apply updates and copy/move files and folder in the installation folder
